# Chess Game 

Chess is a two-player abstract strategy board game. Each player controls sixteen pieces of six types on a chessboard. Each type of piece moves in a distinct way. The object of the game is to checkmate the opponent's king; checkmate occurs when a king is threatened with capture and has no escape.

## Basic rules of Chess Game 

#### Here's a basic rundown on how the rules work. In chess, each player takes turns to make a single move. Players cannot choose to skip a turn - they must move a piece. Each chess piece moves in a specific way, and must be moved according to its legal movement.

  
 **NB- The player with the white pieces always moves first.**

  - Pawn move one square forward in a straight line. They cannot move horizontally, diagonally or backwards.

 - The rook- sometimes called the castle, can move any number of squares horizontally along its current row (rank) or column (file). It cannot pass through pieces of the same colour, and can capture pieces of the opposite colour by moving onto an occupied space. It cannot move diagonally for any reason.
  
 - Knights- move in a fixed ‘L’ pattern: two squares forward, backward, left or right, then one square horizontally or vertically, or vice versa - one square forward, backward, left or right, followed by two squares horizontally or vertically to complete the ‘L’ shape.
  
 - The bishop- can move any number of squares diagonally - this means it always moves along the diagonal line of squares matching the current colour of its square.
  
 - The queen- may move any number of squares horizontally, vertically or diagonally. These movements must be made in a single straight line during a single turn
  
 - The king- moves a single space horizontally, vertically or diagonally.
  
  ### What is check and checkmate?

    When a piece moves in a way that would allow a player to capture the opponent’s king on their next turn, the attacking player typically announces “check”.
